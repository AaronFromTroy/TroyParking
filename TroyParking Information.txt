Due to some of the features we've implemented, you will need a troy.edu email address to register.
This requires the user to click a validation link in an email as well. If you would like to play
with the system we have created, use the log-in credentials below. You will need 2 users to use the
site correctly.

**How the system works**
A user must first hold a spot. This process is pretty straightforward. Once the user holds the
spot, he/she will not be able to leave the hold page until the hold is canceled or someone takes their
spot and the transaction can be completed. A finder can view by lot, which is different depending on the
users parking privileges. The two users included are both students and will be able to share
spots.

**Features not mentioned**
Clicking the profile picture sends the user to a profile page where he/she can change their profile
image, add/remove vehicles, update vehicle images, and examine their current stats.
